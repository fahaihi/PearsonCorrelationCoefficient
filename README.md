Pearson Correlation Coefficient

## Pearson correlation coefficient[1]

In statistics, the Pearson correlation coefficient, is a measure of the linear correlation
between two variables X and Y. It has a value between +1 and -1, where 1 is total positive
linear correlation, 0 is no linear correlation, and -1 is total negative linear correlation.

## Rule of Thumb for Interpreting the Size of a Correlation Coefficient[2]

| Size of Correlation           | Interpretation                            |
| ----------------------------- |:-----------------------------------------:|
| .90 to 1.00 (−.90 to −1.00)   | Very high positive (negative) correlation |
| .70 to .90 (−.70 to −.90)     | High positive (negative) correlation      |
| .50 to .70 (−.50 to −.70)     | Moderate positive (negative) correlation  |
| .30 to .50 (−.30 to −.50)     | Low positive (negative) correlation       |
| .00 to .30 (.00 to −.30)      | negligible correlation                    |
